# Black Box Plus

This project takes the classic Black Box Plus board game (Hexagonal Version) and translates it to a multiplayer, digital version. This project was completed as part of our Software Engineering II
module which was completed in teams of three in which we had to divide work out in a group to meet various sprint deadlines.

# How to play

The aim of the is to guess the location of 6 placed atoms on the board through making use of sending rays from the edge of the board, which depending on a series of possible deflection patterns will 
make it possible to locate the atoms. In the two player version, both players will be able to play as Setter (places the atoms) and Experimenter (guesses atom locations) and a winner will emerge
based on correctly guessed atoms and fewer number of rays sent into the board

## Single Player

Not specified in our original project brief, but our game also features a single player game mode in which you can play against a bot. This bot has the ability to place atoms for the user to guess
when the user is given the Experimenter role but it will also complete a full game, requesting the user to place 6 atoms in which the bot will then attempt to guess. Single player comes in 3 different
difficulties but each come with a certain level of randomness to ensure of a human like game.
